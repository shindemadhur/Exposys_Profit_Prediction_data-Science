## Overview
This application allows users to input the startup's financial data and select a regression algorithm to predict their profit. It also displays evaluation metrics (Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, and R-squared) for the selected algorithm. Additionally, it provides a visual representation of predicted vs. actual profit using Matplotlib.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:
   
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/profit-prediction-app.git
   

2. Change your working directory to the project folder:
   
   cd profit-prediction-app
   

3. Install the required Python packages using pip:
